Context:

"As part of CBI connectivity, the police database instances were not utilizing SSL for secure communication. This was identified as a gap, and we were brought into discussions to implement SSL for enhanced security and compliance."
Objective:

"Today's demo will cover the steps we followed to enable SSL for the police database instances, the testing progress, and the next further actions.


Step-by-Step Process (6–8 minutes)
1. Discussion with the DB Team
"The first step involved collaborating with the DB team to understand the requirements and the process to enable SSL for the police database instances."
2. Certificate Creation and Installation
"Based on the inputs from the DB team, we created and installed the SSL certificate on the database server.
This included ensuring the certificate chain was complete and trusted by the database environment."
3. Enabling SSL and Restarting Services
"After the certificate was installed, SSL was enabled on the database server.
The necessary database services were restarted to apply the changes."
4. Basic Unit Testing
"We performed basic unit testing to validate the SSL configuration.
This included connecting to the database securely and verifying the SSL handshake."
5. Testing One BB Module
"A specific BB module was selected and tested to ensure it worked seamlessly with the SSL-enabled database.
The tests were successful, confirming no immediate issues."
6. Pending End-to-End Testing
"End-to-end testing, including Adhoc job testing, is still pending.
This step is critical to validate the overall system functionality after enabling SSL."
Next Steps (2–3 minutes)
Design, Build, and Test Teams' Assessment

"We need input from the design, build, and test teams to assess and confirm that all functionalities are working as expected."
End-to-End Testing Plan

"Since end-to-end testing is automated in the Performance environment, a decision is needed:
Should we configure and test in the Performance environment?
Or proceed with manual testing in the DevEE environment?"
Final Rollout

"Once testing is complete, the solution will be ready for full deployment across other environments."
Closing (1–2 minutes)
"In summary, we've successfully enabled SSL for the police database instances and validated it through unit testing and a BB module test.
Pending tasks include end-to-end testing and team assessments to finalize the implementation.
I look forward to your input on testing in Perf vs. DevEE and any additional recommendations you may have."

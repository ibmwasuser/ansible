### Rephrased Statement:

Managing numerous certificates through ServiceNow had become increasingly difficult and impractical. This challenge led to the introduction of the Venafi solution. Venafi is a platform that automates the management and renewal of digital certificates, ensuring security and compliance across the organization.

As the IPM team, we played a crucial role in coordinating with all six BAS teams to successfully migrate to Venafi. We are proud to be the first key customer from BAS to have both migrated and renewed certificates using this solution.
